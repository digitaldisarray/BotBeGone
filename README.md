# BotBeGone
Spigot plugin for 1.12.2 that kicks afk people and bots. Also prevent chat abuse.

## Why
With lots of bots and not many good anti bot/afk plugins I thought I would try to make one.
Also today 9b9t got an anti afk plugin that can be bypassed simply by moving your head and moving one block. I want to see if I can make one that is better.

## Features
- Check player head rotation & XZ or XYZ changes.
- Check chat messages for patterns to indicate that they are spamming or are a bot.
- Check for things like world interaction to verify the player is not a bot.
- Kick the afk players or bots.
- Config files?
